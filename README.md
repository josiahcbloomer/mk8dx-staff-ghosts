# Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Staff Ghosts
This repo contians the staff ghost files for all 96 courses in the game, for both 150cc and 200cc.

For help decoding the information within the files & filenames, see [this page from the MK8Leaderboards repo](https://github.com/Dinostraw/MK8Leaderboards/wiki/Ghost-Data-%28Deluxe%29).

I have already processed the filename data into two JSON files, [150cc.json](https://github.com/josiahcbloomer/mk8dx-staff-ghosts/blob/main/150cc.json) and [200cc.json](https://github.com/josiahcbloomer/mk8dx-staff-ghosts/blob/main/200cc.json).

If anyone is interested in helping me further decode the replay information in these staff ghost files, please reach out on Discord (username: jcb1032).
